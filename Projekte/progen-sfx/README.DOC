This diskette comes upon request with the paper:


R.Kolisch, A.Sprecher and A.Drexl (1992):"Characterization and Generation
   of a General Class of Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems",
   Working Paper, Institut fuer Betriebswirtschaftslehre, Christian-Albrechts-
   Universitaet zu Kiel, Germany, to appear in Management Science.

It contains the instance generator PROGEN as well as all instances which
were used in the computational study of the paper. The content is organized
as follows: There are five directories (PROGEN, INSTANCE, EXAMPLE, LHA, and
PAR&SOL), with the following files:

1. PROGEN: Contents are the executable version of PROGEN, the code of
           the units TYPEDECL, PROGEN, NETWGEN, REQGEN, AVAILGEN, and INOUT.
           The executable version of PROGEN can be started straight forward.

           If the user wants to adjust the size of arrays to specific needs,
           he can do so by employing the code of the units TYPEDECL and
           PROGEN. For details he is kindly advised to confer to the appendix
           of the paper.

           Note that with the executable version of PROGEN the instances
           used in the computational study are fully reproducable. In
           the case of a new compilation one has to use the below listed
           compiler options in order to attain a code which will guarantee
           reproducibility w.r.t. the computational study.
           Compiler options: {$A+}, {$B+}, {$D+}, {$E-}, {$F-}, {$G-},
                             {$I+}, {$L+}, {$N-}, {$O-}, {$R+}, {$S+},
                             {$V+}, {$X+}.

2.INSTANCE:Contents are three compressed files (SMFF, SMCP, MMFF) with
           each file in the LZH-format as well as the three files SMFF.OPT,
           SMCP.OPT, and MMFF.OPT which contain the solutions derived with
           the optimal procedures, the parameters, and the original file-
           names.

           SMFF.LZH

                contains the compressed 480 instances for the single-mode
                full factorial design experiment. The files are re-numbered
                from 1 to 480 in order to ease computational studies. Further-
                more the files are converted from the ProGen-format into the
                Patterson-format (with suffix "rcp"). This format is as fol-
                lows: Let denote

                j=1,...,J : jobs
                r=1,...,R : resource types
                S(j)      : number of immediate successor-jobs of job j
                S(j,s)    : s-th immediate successor-job of job j
                d(j)      : non-preemptable duration of job j
                K(r)      : resource availability of resource type r within
                            each period
                k(j,r)    : resource usage of job j w.r.t. resource type r

                The format is:

                J       R

                K(1)    K(2)    ..     ..      K(R)

                d(1)    k(1,1)  ..      k(1,R)  S(1)    S(1,1)  ..      S(1,S(1))
                ..      ..      ..      ..      ..      ..      ..      ..
                d(J)    k(J,1)  ..      k(J,R)  S(J)    0

                Example: (J=5; R=2; K(1)=3; K(2)=2)

           SMFF.OPT

               contains for each of the 480 instances of the single-mode
               full-factorial design experiment the following information:

               NR    : The re-numbered file number (1-480)
               ZOPT  : best objective function value derived with the
                       Demeulemeester-algorithm.
               TOTPT : The cpu-time in seconds needed to assure optimality
                       of the solution. Note that for TOPT >= 3600 no
                       optimal solution has been found and hence for
                       TOPT < 3600 the optimal objective function value is
                       ZOPT.
               NC            : level of the network complexity
               RF            : level of the resource factor
               RS            : level of the resource strength
               ORIG.FILENAME : Filename originally used before renumbering
                               and converting the format.

           SMCP.LZH

                contains the 200 instances for the single-mode ceteris
                paribus design experiment.  Again, these files are renumbered
                and are converted into the Patterson-format.

           SMCP.OPT

               contains for each of the 200 instances of the single-mode
               ceteris paribus experiment the following information:

                NUMBER       : New file number
                ZOPT         : Best ojective function value
                TOPT         : See above
                JOBS         : Number of jobs
                RESOURCES    : Number of resource types
                #START-JOBS  : Number of immediate successor jobs of the dummy
                               source
                RF           : Level of the resource factor
                ORIG.FILENAME: See above


           MMFF.LZH

                contains the 536 feasible instances of the multi-
                mode full factorial design experiment. The files were
                re-numberd from 1 to 536 and are in the originally
                ProGen-format.

           MMFF.OPT

               contains for each of the 536 instances of the multi-mode
               full factorial design experiment the following information:

                NUMBER       :  New file number
                ZOPT         :  Optimal objective function value
                TOPT         :  CPU-time needed to derive the optimal objective
                                function value
                RF(N)        :  Level of the resource factor for the nonre-
                                newable resource types
                RS(N)        :  Level of the resource strength for the non-
                                renewable resource types
                RF(R)        :  Level of the resource factor for the renewable
                                resource types
                RS(R)        :  Level of the resource strength for the renewable
                                resource types
                ORIG.FILENAME:  Original filename

           The instances can either be extracted automatically or manually:

           I)  Extracting instances automatically:

               Typing

               a:\extract

               will automatically create for each type of instance a directory
               on C:\ (e.g. C:\SMFF, C:\SMCP, and C:\MMFF). The files will then
               be extracted into the appropriate directories.

           II) Extracting instances manually:

               All three files have to be extracted by using the archiver
               LHA which is in a separate directory. Extracting a file works
               as follows:

               i)  copy one LZH-file and the program LHA.EXE in a separate
                   directory

               ii) Type the command: "LHA e filename *.*" to extract the
                   instances in the file filename.LZH, e.g. "LHA e SMFF *.*"
                   will extract the 480 single-mode instances.

3.EXAMPLE: Contents are an example of a basedata-file (EXPL.BAS), an
           instance-file (EXPL1.DAT) and an error-file (EXPL.ERR), respectively.
           For further informations the user is kindly advised to confer
           to the appendix of the paper. Instances to own needs should
           be generated by using a copy of the basedata-file where the
           parameters are appropriately adjusted.

           Note that the file EXPL1.DAT differs from the file printed in
           Table 27 with respect to job 3 in mode 1 using 9 units of the
           nonrenewable resource 1 (8 units in the paper) as well as the
           overall availability of the nonrenewable resource 1 with 44
           units (43 units in the paper). Differences are due to running
           the program with different compiler options.

4.LHA:     Contents are the three files belonging to the package of the
           archiver LHA (program, document- and help-file). In order to
           use this archiver for our purposes we have to distribute the
           total package.

5.PARAMET  Content is the files PARAM.SET. It contains the parameters levels
           for each field (base-file) used in the computational study. Each
           base-file uniquely corresponds with its 10 instance-files (with
           the original file name) generated.
